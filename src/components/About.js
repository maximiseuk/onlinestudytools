          The Maximise team have pulled together many{" "}

          The resources provided are evidence based but the real genius of this
          product is that it is written by
          <span className="highlight">young people for young people</span>. We
          know that during the teenage years, young people are more likely to
          listen to their peers than adults.{" "}
